# Accent-Aware Speech Recognition System

This project implements an **Accent-Aware Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** system using deep learning. It includes speaker adaptation and data augmentation techniques to enhance recognition accuracy across different accents.

## 🚀 Features

- Deep learning-based speech-to-text transcription
- Accent-aware training and evaluation
- Speaker adaptation techniques
- Data augmentation for robust performance
- Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation
- Power BI reports for results visualization

## 📦 Requirements

Install dependencies (if using a virtual environment):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key libraries:
- `torchaudio`
- `transformers`
- `datasets`
- `scikit-learn`
- `librosa`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

## 🧪 Running the Code

Open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/Accent_Aware_ASR.ipynb
```

OR run in Google Colab by uploading the `.ipynb` file.

## 📊 Reporting

Power BI reports (`.pbit`, `.pbix`) provide visual analytics of model accuracy and accent performance.
